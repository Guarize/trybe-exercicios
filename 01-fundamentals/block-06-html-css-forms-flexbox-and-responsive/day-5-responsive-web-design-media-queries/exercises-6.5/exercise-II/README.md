# Part II - Creating 3 different layouts using mobile first.
<br />

- [x] 1 - Using the mobile first approach and media queries, create three different layout versions for this page. Each layout should correspond to a different page size (small, medium and large). Do at least one commit for each layout;
- [x] 2 - To do this properly, you must pay attention to the content of the page and think about how to display it in each of the screen sizes:
    * Where should the chapter list be positioned?
    * How should the story be shown?
    * How should the header be positioned?
    * What to do with author information on each screen size?
- [x] 3 - You may need to change the HTML a bit, adding elements to make styling easier, or perhaps moving a block around within the page.
