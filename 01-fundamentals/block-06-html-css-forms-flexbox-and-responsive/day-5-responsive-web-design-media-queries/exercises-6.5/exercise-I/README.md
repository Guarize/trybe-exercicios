# Part I - Creating a Page for a Small Screen
<br />

- [x] 1 - Make the font size bigger;
- [ ] 2 - Make the font size of the h1 elements smaller;
- [ ] 3 - Increase the spacing between the pictures;
- [ ] 4 - Add some margin to the page.
- [ ] 5 - Save the screen width at the point that you identified that the current layout did not work well (for example 800px) . This will be the first breakpoint of the layout . A breakpoint is just a point where we are defining that the current design should change;
- [ ] 6 - Create a media query in your CSS file, using the pixel dimension you saved as the min-width of the media query test. Inside this breakpoint, add the following settings:
    * Change the background color (this will help you see when the media query has taken effect);
    * Adjust the font size;
    * Adjust the page margins;
    * Make the images be displayed in two columns.
- [ ] 7 - Now you will create another breakpoint for large screens. Resize your canvas again to find a new breakpoint.
- [ ] 8 - Create a new media query in your CSS file using the dimension you found for large screens (for example 1300px) , and make the following adjustments within the breakpoint :
    * Change the background color;
    * Adjust the font size;
    * Adjust the page margins;
    * Add the max-width property to the page, to make sure that the width of the lines is not too large.
