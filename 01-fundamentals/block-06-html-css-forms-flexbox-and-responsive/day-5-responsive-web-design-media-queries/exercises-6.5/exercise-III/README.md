- [x] 1 - Add a media query to the CSS file and the necessary rules to make the page look like the image below when it is printed. Specifically:
    * The elements with id header, navigation and footer should disappear;
    * The element with id aside should be shown below the main content.
- [ ] 2 - Add a media query in the CSS file and the necessary rules to make the page look like the images below when the screen is resized to smaller widths. Specifically:
    * The element with id aside must disappear;
    * The body element must not have padding ;
    * Images should not exceed the width of the screen;
    * The items within the navigation element should each appear on their own line;
    * The element with id header should be fixed, so that it always appears at the top of the screen even after the user scrolls down the page.
