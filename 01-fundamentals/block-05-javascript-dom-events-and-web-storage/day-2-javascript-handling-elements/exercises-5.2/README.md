# Let's Practice:

## The goal of these exercises is to put into practice what you have just learned about DOM. Therefore, you should do the exercises using only JavaScript code, which must be inserted between the `<script>` and `</script>` tags.

<br>

- [ ] 1 - Add a `h1` tag with the text `Exerc√≠cio 5.2 - JavaScript DOM` as child of the `body` tag;
- [ ] 2 - Add the `main` tag with the `main-content` class as a child of the `body` tag;
- [ ] 3 - Add the `section` tag with the `center-content` class as child of the `main` tag created in step 2;
- [ ] 4 - Add the `p` tag as a child of the `section` created in step 3 and put some text in it;
- [ ] 5 - Add the `section` tag with the class `left-content` as a child of the `main` tag created in step 2;
- [ ] 6 - Add the `section` tag with class `right-content` as a child of the main tag created in step 2;
- [ ] 7 - Add an image with `src` set to the value `https://picsum.photos/200` and class `small-image`. This element should be the child of the `section` created in step 5;
- [ ] 8 - Add an `unordered list` with the values 1 to 10 (written), i.e. one , two , three , ... as list values. This list should be a child of the `section` created in step 6;
- [ ] 9 - Add 3 `h3` tags, all being children of the `main` tag created in step 2.

<br>

## Now that you have created a lot, let's make some changes and removals:

<br>

- [ ] 10 - Add a `title` class to the created `h1` tag;
- [ ] 11 - Add the `description` class to the 3 `h3` tags you created;
- [ ] 12 - Remove the `section` created in step 5 (the one with the `left-content` class). Use the `.removeChild()` function;
- [ ] 13 - Center the `section` created in step 6 (the one with the `right-content` class). Tip: To center it, simply set the section's `margin-right: auto` ;
- [ ] 14 - Change the background color of the parent element of the section created in step 3 (the one with the `center-content` class) to green;
- [ ] 15 - Remove the last two elements (nine and ten) from the list created in step 8.
